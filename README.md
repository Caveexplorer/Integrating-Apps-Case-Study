# Integrating Apps Case Study

In this project we work with some Apple and Google app data to answer the question of whether Apple Store apps receive better reviews than Google Play apps.

The project has two csv files that came from Kaggle that you'll use to complete the project. The Google app data comes from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and is named googleplaystore.csv

The Apple app data comes from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) and is named AppleStore.csv
